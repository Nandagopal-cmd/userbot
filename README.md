# Q&A
Q: SSL Certificate Error

A: Just install CRT File. Then run it and install. (This is common and it was a certificate that expired May 30th 2020. But a new one came out so install it.). If you wanna go into further detail then head to SITE.

Q: Module Missing

A: Just run pip install -r requirements.txt in console. This insures that all modules required for Snaxes are installed and up to date!
